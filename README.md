# SuperGrid!
I wrote this add-on for Unity because I like to see the grid I'm working on and I'm tired of pressing CTRL. 
To use it open the Editor Window located at **Tools/SuperGrid**.

# Installing SuperGrid using Git
To install SuperGrid in your project use the Unity Package Manager.  
To open the Unity Package Manager, inside unity, go to `Window > Package Manager` and to install SuperGrid click the `+` icon in the upper left corner of the window, then click on `Add package from git URL...` and paste in `https://github.com/lulasz/SuperGrid.git`
